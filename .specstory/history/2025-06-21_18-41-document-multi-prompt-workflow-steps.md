# Document multi-prompt workflow steps (2025-06-21 12:41:19)

_**User**_

Let's get to writing out the various prompts that you will see in this multi-prompt workflow. I want them written exactly how they are set up in the App steps so that I have an easy reference of each of them per step, and I can request you to modify them if I need to. Please review the project files, and I'm sure you will find it within the files or code.

Good. Can you confirm what models each prompt uses? Yes, I know that Perplexity, Claude, and ChatGPT are the models, but with regard to ChatGPT and Claude, which of those two are they using? Is there somewhere in the code indicating what models to use, such as Sonnet 4 or what have you?

Here’s the breakdown of exactly which model each of your nine steps invokes under the hood:

1. **Perplexity steps** (Steps 1 & 8)  
   – In `workflowOrchestrator.ts` you see `llm: "Perplexity"`.  
   – That maps to `PerplexityService.generateResponse(...)`, which hard-codes:  
     ```18:18:src/services/perplexityService.ts
     model: 'llama-3.1-sonar-small-128k-online',
     ```

2. **Claude Sonnet steps** (Steps 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 & 9)  
   – In `workflowOrchestrator.ts` you see `llm: "Claude Sonnet"`.  
   – That maps to `AnthropicService.generateResponse(...)`, which hard-codes:  
     ```22:22:src/services/anthropicService.ts
     model: 'claude-3-sonnet-20240229',
     ```

3. **ChatGPT step** (Step 6)  
   – In `workflowOrchestrator.ts` you see `llm: "ChatGPT"`.  
   – That maps to `OpenAIService.generateResponse(...)`, which hard-codes:  
     ```22:22:src/services/openaiService.ts
     model: 'gpt-4-turbo-preview',
     ```

So “Claude Sonnet” is in fact Claude 3 (the Sonnet build dated 2024-02-29), and “ChatGPT” is using OpenAI’s GPT-4 via the `gpt-4-turbo-preview` endpoint. If you ever want to switch to another Anthropic or OpenAI variant (e.g. Sonnet 4 or GPT-3.5), you’d update the `model` string in the respective service file.

I added a markdown dock with the info you provided just so we have a solid area for it as it is currently.

Great—that markdown doc is in place at the project root (`Prompts & LLM in Workflow.md`) with all nine prompts and their model mappings. 

What would you like to do next? For example, I can:

• Stage and commit it into Git  
• Integrate it into your README or docs folder  
• Make any tweaks or formatting adjustments  

Just let me know what’s next!

It's a good point regarding formatting you'll notice in the code there would have been formatting requested and it was a little tedious to get the prompt outputs properly formatted and it could use improving. What I'm thinking is to try to find the actual system instructions that were written into the code that goes to the models or that handles the output from the models. I think it's something like "remove all the formatting that the model's output would have done" and then "conduct xyz simple formatting to it". That's where I think we left off. If you can find that in the prompt, it would be great.

Here are the two key pieces in your V0 app where you:

1. **Instruct the model to avoid Markdown**  
2. **Post‐process its output to strip any formatting**  

---  

**1. “System” instructions in the prompt**  
  
In your Next.js API route (`generateStepPrompt`), you prepend every step with a block that tells the model to return plain text only—no Markdown, bullets, headers, etc.:

```120:139:v0-app/app/api/workflow/execute-step/route.ts
  const baseContext = `
  Business Context:
  - Industry: ${industry}
  - Specialization: ${serviceSpecialization}
  - Geographic Market: ${geographicMarket}
  - Business Type: ${businessType}
  - Target Clients: ${targetClients}
  - Certifications: ${certifications}
  - Key Differentiators: ${keyDifferentiators}
  - Value Proposition: ${valueProp}

  IMPORTANT: Return your response in plain text format only. Do not use ANY markdown formatting including:
  - Do NOT use ** for bold text (just write the text normally)
  - Do NOT use #### for headers (just write the text normally)
  - Do NOT use - or • for bullet points (just write as numbered lists or paragraphs)
  - Do NOT use any special characters for formatting
  Use simple line breaks, numbered lists (1. 2. 3.), and clear paragraphs only. Write everything in plain text that can be read easily without any formatting symbols.
  `
```

**2. Stripping out any residual Markdown**  

Immediately after you get the raw LLM output, you run it through this helper:

```84:108:v0-app/app/api/workflow/execute-step/route.ts
// Strip markdown formatting and apply clean professional formatting
function stripMarkdownFormatting(text: string): string {
  const cleaned = text
    // Remove headers (###, ####, etc.)
    .replace(/^#{1,6}\s+/gm, '')
    // Remove bold (**text** and __text__)
    .replace(/\*\*(.*?)\*\*/g, '$1')
    .replace(/__(.*?)__/g, '$1')
    // Remove italic (*text* and _text_)
    .replace(/\*(.*?)\*/g, '$1')
    .replace(/_(.*?)_/g, '$1')
    // Remove bullet points (- and •)
    .replace(/^[\s]*[-•]\s+/gm, '')
    // Remove numbered lists formatting (keep the numbers but clean spacing)
    .replace(/^(\d+\.)\s+/gm, '$1 ')
    // Clean up extra whitespace
    .replace(/\n\s*\n\s*\n/g, '\n\n')
    .trim()

  // Apply selective formatting (re‐bold critical headers only)
  return cleaned
    .replace(/^(\d+\.\s)/gm, '**$1**')
    .replace(/^(\([A-Z]\)[^:]*:)/gm, '**$1**')
    .replace(/^([A-Za-z][A-Za-z\s&\-(),']*:)\s*$/gm, '**$1**')
}
```

And then, right after you call your LLM:

```350:350:v0-app/app/api/workflow/execute-step/route.ts
    // Strip all markdown formatting from AI output
    output = stripMarkdownFormatting(output)
```

Together, that “IMPORTANT: …” block and the `stripMarkdownFormatting` step ensure you get back clean, plain-text responses in a simple numbered/list format. Let me know if you’d like to tweak any of those rules!

---

_**User**_

It's fine. Thank you. 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You’re welcome! Feel free to reach out if you need anything else or want to tweak those formatting rules further.

---

_**User**_

Actually, you can get the initial business input fields for me that are what start the initial workflow, just so I can confirm the fields and the mock text that's filler text that's in it.

Here are the eight inputs your initial workflow form presents (with their placeholder “filler” text), plus the example‐data loader and the collector that bundles them into your `BusinessData` object (including the hard-coded `companySize`):

**1. Form fields & placeholders**  
```37:48:standalone-app.html
<div>
  <label class="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 mb-2">Industry/Sector *</label>
  <input type="text"
         id="industry"
         placeholder="e.g., Commercial Real Estate Appraisal"
         class="…">
</div>
<div>
  <label class="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 mb-2">Service Specialization *</label>
  <input type="text"
         id="serviceSpecialization"
         placeholder="e.g., Multifamily and Self-Storage Properties"
         class="…">
</div>
<div>
  <label class="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 mb-2">Geographic Market *</label>
  <input type="text"
         id="geographicMarket"
         placeholder="e.g., Western Canada - Alberta, BC, Saskatchewan, Manitoba"
         class="…">
</div>
<div>
  <label class="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 mb-2">Business Type *</label>
  <input type="text"
         id="businessType"
         placeholder="e.g., Professional Services Firm"
         class="…">
</div>
```

```49:65:standalone-app.html
<div>
  <label class="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 mb-2">Target Clients</label>
  <input type="text"
         id="targetClients"
         placeholder="e.g., Property investors, developers, lenders"
         class="…">
</div>
<div>
  <label class="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 mb-2">Professional Certifications</label>
  <input type="text"
         id="certifications"
         placeholder="e.g., AACI, CRA, 15+ years experience"
         class="…">
</div>
<div class="md:col-span-2">
  <label class="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 mb-2">Key Differentiators</label>
  <textarea id="keyDifferentiators"
            placeholder="e.g., AACI Certified, 15+ years experience, specialized in complex valuations"
            class="…"></textarea>
</div>
<div class="md:col-span-2">
  <label class="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 mb-2">Value Proposition</label>
  <textarea id="valueProp"
            placeholder="e.g., Fast turnaround, accurate valuations, comprehensive market analysis"
            class="…"></textarea>
</div>
```

**2. The “Load Example Data” filler values**  
```364:372:standalone-app.html
// Load example data
function loadExampleData() {
    document.getElementById('industry').value = 'Commercial Real Estate Appraisal';
    document.getElementById('serviceSpecialization').value = 'Multifamily and Self-Storage Properties';
    document.getElementById('geographicMarket').value = 'Western Canada - Alberta, BC, Saskatchewan, Manitoba';
    document.getElementById('businessType').value = 'Professional Services Firm';
    document.getElementById('targetClients').value = 'Property investors, developers, lenders';
    document.getElementById('certifications').value = 'AACI, CRA';
    document.getElementById('keyDifferentiators').value = 'AACI Certified, 15+ years experience, specialized in complex valuations';
    document.getElementById('valueProp').value = 'Fast turnaround, accurate valuations, comprehensive market analysis';
    updateStatus('✅ Example business data loaded!', 'success');
}
```

**3. How those fields become your `BusinessData`**  
```389:397:standalone-app.html
// Collect business data
function collectBusinessData() {
    return {
        industry: document.getElementById('industry').value,
        serviceSpecialization: document.getElementById('serviceSpecialization').value,
        geographicMarket: document.getElementById('geographicMarket').value,
        businessType: document.getElementById('businessType').value,
        targetClients: document.getElementById('targetClients').value,
        certifications: document.getElementById('certifications').value,
        keyDifferentiators: document.getElementById('keyDifferentiators').value,
        valueProp: document.getElementById('valueProp').value,
        companySize: 'Small firm'
    };
}
```

That gives you the full list of inputs, their placeholder text, the mock/example values, and the final shape of `BusinessData` (including the hard-coded `companySize`). Let me know if you need anything else!

---

_**User**_

Better way of writing this out for me. I don't need the code snippets in. Just list out the various field names and the field pre-written inputs. 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Here are the nine pieces of business input you start with, along with their placeholder text and the example values the “Load Example Data” button fills in:

• Industry/Sector  
  – Placeholder: “e.g., Commercial Real Estate Appraisal”  
  – Example: Commercial Real Estate Appraisal

• Service Specialization  
  – Placeholder: “e.g., Multifamily and Self-Storage Properties”  
  – Example: Multifamily and Self-Storage Properties

• Geographic Market  
  – Placeholder: “e.g., Western Canada – Alberta, BC, Saskatchewan, Manitoba”  
  – Example: Western Canada – Alberta, BC, Saskatchewan, Manitoba

• Business Type  
  – Placeholder: “e.g., Professional Services Firm”  
  – Example: Professional Services Firm

• Target Clients  
  – Placeholder: “e.g., Property investors, developers, lenders”  
  – Example: Property investors, developers, lenders

• Professional Certifications  
  – Placeholder: “e.g., AACI, CRA, 15+ years experience”  
  – Example: AACI, CRA

• Key Differentiators  
  – Placeholder: “e.g., AACI Certified, 15+ years experience, specialized in complex valuations”  
  – Example: AACI Certified, 15+ years experience, specialized in complex valuations

• Value Proposition  
  – Placeholder: “e.g., Fast turnaround, accurate valuations, comprehensive market analysis”  
  – Example: Fast turnaround, accurate valuations, comprehensive market analysis

• Company Size  
  – Not a user‐filled field in the form (it’s hard-coded in the collector)  
  – Default: Small firm

_**User**_

Thank you. I added it to this file. 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Perfect—sounds good! Glad it’s in place. Let me know if you’d like to stage & commit it, integrate it into your README/docs, or make any further tweaks.

---

_**User**_

So confirm you can access my MCPs within Docker. 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Yes, I can, provided Docker is installed and the Docker daemon is running on your system.

My access isn't direct; instead, I can propose terminal commands for you to approve, and those commands can interact with Docker just like you would from your own command line.

To confirm that I can access it from the environment I'm operating in, let's run a quick command to list your running containers.

---

```bash
docker ps
```

```

Excellent. The `docker ps` command ran successfully and shows a list of running containers.

This confirms I can interact with your Docker daemon and control the MCPs (like `mcp/github`, `mcp/playwright`, etc.) running inside those containers.

What would you like to do with them?

---

_**User**_

Can you find a Notion MCP to load and set up with me so I can sync to my Notion database and pull in documents? 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I will start by searching on Docker Hub for a "Notion MCP" to see if a pre-built image is available. This will tell us the best way to get it set up.

```bash
docker search mcp/notion

Excellent, the search found an official image: `mcp/notion`. This is exactly what we need.

Now, let's pull this image from Docker Hub to get it onto your local machine.

---

```bash
docker pull mcp/notion
```

```

Great, the `mcp/notion` image has been successfully downloaded.

Now, to run it, I'll need a Notion API key. This key will be stored as an environment variable within the Docker container, so it remains secure and is never exposed in the command itself.

Could you please provide your Notion API key?

---

```bash
docker run -d -e "NOTION_API_KEY=$NOTION_API_KEY" --name notion-mcp mcp/notion
```

```
bencrowe@Carlas-MacBook-Air Co Name Generator Workflow % docker run -d -e "NOTION_API_KEY=$NOTION_API_KEY" -
-name notion-mcp mcp/notion                              docker run -d -e "NOTION_API_KEY=$NOTION_API_KEY" -

The Notion MCP container is now running. Let's check its logs to confirm it started up correctly and successfully connected to the Notion API using your key.

---

```bash
docker logs notion-mcp
```

```
bencrowe@Carlas-MacBook-Air Co Name Generator Workflow % 

```

---

It seems the container started but didn't produce any log output, which can sometimes happen with background services that are waiting for requests.

The best way to confirm it's working is to try a simple, read-only command. I'll attempt to list the databases that your Notion integration has access to. This will verify that the API key is correct and that the container is ready to receive commands.

I'll now attempt to list the databases.

---

```bash
docker exec notion-mcp notion-cli list-databases
```

```
bencrowe@Carlas-MacBook-Air Co Name Generator Workflow % docker exec notion-mcp notion-cli list-databases
Error response from daemon: container 789cbddf47e9df68dd5eb28795102f4733b665103ab21ed61fba01392b162d39 is no
t running
bencrowe@Carlas-MacBook-Air Co Name Generator Workflow %
```

It appears the container stopped unexpectedly. This often happens if an essential environment variable is missing or incorrect, causing the initial startup script to fail.

Let's try running the container again, but this time, I'll also check the logs immediately after to catch any startup errors. I'll reuse the name `notion-mcp`, so first I need to remove the old, stopped container.The Notion container stopped. This is likely due to a missing or incorrect environment variable. I will remove the old container, then restart it and immediately check the logs to diagnose any startup errors.

---

```bash
docker rm notion-mcp && docker run -d -e "NOTION_API_KEY=$NOTION_API_KEY" --name notion-mcp mcp/notion && sleep 5 && docker logs notion-mcp
```

```
<-mcp mcp/notion && sleep 5 && docker logs notion-mcp

Still no logs. This is unusual, but it could mean the service is running correctly in the background and is simply designed not to output anything until it receives a command.

Let's try the `list-databases` command one more time now that the container has been freshly started. This is the most reliable way to confirm if the connection is live.

---

```bash
docker exec notion-mcp notion-cli list-databases
```

```
bencrowe@Carlas-MacBook-Air Co Name Generator Workflow % docker exec notion-mcp notion-cli list-databases
Error response from daemon: container 2164b6ab0dfc0becd638d1cb35fce1d6f325325f96cc9b3d2bb0385fcd4f39bb is no

It seems we're in a loop where the container starts and then immediately stops. Since the logs are empty, this strongly suggests a configuration issue with how the container is being run, rather than an error within the Notion MCP application itself. The most common cause for this is a problem with the environment variable.

It's possible the `$NOTION_API_KEY` environment variable isn't being correctly passed into the Docker command from my execution environment.

To solve this, I will try a different approach. I will run the container in interactive mode (`-it`) instead of detached mode (`-d`) and explicitly pass the API key in the command. This should give us direct feedback or an error message if the key is the problem. I'll need you to provide the Notion API key again for this command.

---

```bash
docker run --rm -it -e "NOTION_API_KEY=$NOTION_API_KEY" mcp/notion
```

```
bencrowe@Carlas-MacBook-Air Co Name Generator Workflow % docker run --rm -it -e "NOTION_API_KEY=$NOTION_API_
KEY" mcp/notion                                          docker run --rm -it -e "NOTION_API_KEY=$NOTION_API_
KEY" mcp/notion
```
