“o3” is the internal code-name of the large-language-model family powering this assistant.  It’s the next-generation model after the “gpt-4” (sometimes called “o2”) series, so yes—it’s a newer model with upgrades in reasoning, coding, and overall accuracy.  “Pro” here just refers to the higher-performance tier rather than a separate architecture.

Okay, I got it. Do you have search capacity in this thread? Can you look up "o3 pro" from OpenAI and confirm if it actually is a new model of o3.

Yes—this chat can pull information from the public web.  
I just looked up “o3 pro” and found several independent confirmations that it is indeed a new, upgraded version of the o-series reasoning model:

• TechCrunch (10 June 2025) reports that OpenAI “launched o3-pro, an AI model that the company claims is its most capable yet,” replacing o1-pro for ChatGPT Pro and Team users and already available in the developer API.  
• OpenRouter’s model catalog lists “openai/o3-pro-2025-06-10,” describing it as a higher-compute variant of o3 that “thinks harder and provides consistently better answers.”  
• A Generative AI article on Medium (11 June 2025) summarizes the announcement and positions o3-pro as OpenAI’s most advanced multi-modal reasoning model, with stronger performance than the base o3.

So yes: “o3 pro” is a newer, higher-performance member of the o-series family, not just a rebrand.
